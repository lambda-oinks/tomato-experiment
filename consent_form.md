You have been asked to be a volunteer in a research study that is taking place on the evening of April 1, 2014 at 7D, San Francisco. 

Introduction
-----------------
Christopher and Oinkina a longstanding dispute about the quality of Oinkina's tomato vs. his. To this end, Christopher and Oinkina designed a double-blinded experiment. Christopher's tomato selection will be compared with Oinkina's selection both Christopher and Oinkina by thirdparty volunteers. 

Methods
------------
Earlier today, Christopher and Oinkina to El Produce market and independently selected tomatoes from their cheapest batch of $0.79/lb. tomatoes. These tomato selections were then labelled "C" and "E" to distinguish. Then a tomato was selected from each and placed upside-down on a small plate. One of the tomato plates was labelled with a note with a star on the bottom, while the other was left unmarked. A piece of paper was folded up with the key for which batch the starred plate corresponds to. 

We are seeking a volunteer to administer the test (the "Administrator"). The Administrator will cut each tomato, keeping them corresponding to their respective plates. They will also mix up the plates so that Christopher and Oinkina't which plate is labelled. 

We are also seeking volunteers to take the test[^1]. The Administrator will offer a slice from each plate to Christopher, Oinkina and the tasters. Without conversing, each taster will record their opinions of which plate contained the better tomato. 

Finally, the Administrator will open up the paper with the key and tally the marks for each. 


Significance
------------------
This research will resolve important open problems in the field, primarily: 

1) Do Oinkina or Christopher have real preference for the tomatoes that they pick, or is it perhaps psychological? 

2) Are Oinkina's or Christopher's selection objectively superior (as determined by third-party volunteers)?
