You have been asked to be a volunteer in a research study that is taking place on the evening of April 1, 2014 at 7 Delano Ave, San Francisco, CA 94112. 

Introduction
-----------------
Christopher and Eliana have a long-standing dispute about the quality of Eliana's tomato picking vs. his. To this end, Christopher and Eliana have designed a simple double-blinded experiment. Christopher's tomato selection will be compared with Eliana's selection by both Christopher and Eliana and by third-party volunteers. 

Background
------------------
Eliana has been studying the field of Tomato Selection for the past 13 years. Christopher has been vegetarian for the past 17 years.

Methods
------------
Earlier today, Christopher and Eliana went to El Chico Produce market and independently selected tomatoes from their cheapest batch of $0.79/lb. tomatoes. These tomato selections were then labelled "C" and "E" to distinguish. Then a tomato was selected from each and placed upside-down on a small plate. One of the tomato plates was labelled with a note with a star on the bottom, while the other was left unmarked. A piece of paper was folded up with the key for which batch the starred plate corresponds to. 

We are seeking a volunteer to administer the test (the "Administrator"). The Administrator will cut each tomato, keeping them corresponding to their respective plates. They will also mix up the plates so that Christopher and Eliana don't know which plate is labelled. 

We are also seeking volunteers to take the test[^1]. The Administrator will offer a slice from each plate to Christopher, Eliana, and the volunteer tasters. Without conversing, each taster will record their opinions of which plate contained the better tomato. 

Finally, the Administrator will open up the paper with the key and tally the marks for each. 

Plan for Interpreting Results
----------------------------------------
We will consider which tomato on average received the higher rating, and also which Eliana and Christopher individually preferred.

Expected Results
--------------------------
It is expected that Eliana will be more likely to determine a difference in the tomato qualities than other subjects. 

Potential Issues
-----------------------
While the ultimate objective would be to determine the quality of Eliana's tomato selection relative to an average Tomato Selector, Christopher is not representative of an average Tomato Selector, due to his many years of training as a vegetarian and vegan. This experiment can only give insight into the differences between Eliana's selection and Christopher's. A conflating factor is that the batch at the El Chico wasn't very high quality.

Significance
------------------
This research will resolve important open problems in the field, primarily: 1) Do Eliana and Christopher have a real preference for the tomatoes that they pick, or is it perhaps psychological? and 2) Are Eliana's or Christopher's selection objectively superior (as determined by third-party volunteers)?

Volunteer Terms

Risks/Discomforts:
There are no foreseeable risks/discomforts in this study.

Costs to you:
There are no costs to you.

Benefits: 
You are not likely going to benefit in any way from joining this study, beyond receiving two slices of tomato of questionable quality. However, your participation in this study will contribute to our understanding of tomato selection and its affect on quality such that we can look to improve the average tomato quality at 7D.

Confidentiality:
You will not be asked for your name or other identifying information. The data that is collected will be kept private to the extent allowed by law. To make sure that this research is being carried out in the proper way, the 7 Delano Internal Review Board may review study records. However, the aggregate information may be used in a blog post by Oinkina.

Subject Rights:
* Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to be in this study if you don't want to be.
* You have the right to change your mind and leave the study at any time without giving any reason, and without penalty. 
* You may spit out a particularly unpleasant tomato slice if need be without any penalty.

Questions About the Study or Your Rights as a Research Subject
* If you have any questions about the study, you may contact Eliana Lorch or Christopher Olah at 7 Delano Ave, San Francisco, CA 94112.
