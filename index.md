If you see me in the kitchen snacking, there will likely be juice and seeds dripping down my chin. I love tomatoes and have been exalting their many benefits and superior snacking qualities for many, many years.

I've long believed that I have a more sophisticated taste for tomatoes than an average tomato eater, and I am better at spotting treasures than an average grocery shopper.

Experiment Design
---------

While I was convinced that I had superior tomato selection skills, science had to be the final arbiter, of course. 

I designed an experiment with my friend Chris, and emailed my housemates at 7D with the following proposal, edited for anonymity and clarity:

<blockquote>
### Introduction
Chris and Oinkina have a long-standing dispute about the quality of Oinkina's tomato picking vs. his. To this end, Chris and Oinkina have designed a simple double-blinded experiment[^1]. Chris' tomato selection will be compared with Oinkina's selection by both Chris and Oinkina and by third-party volunteers. 

### Background
Oinkina has been studying the field of Tomato Selection for the past 13 years. Chris has been vegetarian for the past 17 years.

### Methods
Earlier today, Chris and Oinkina went to El Chico Produce market and independently selected tomatoes from their cheapest batch of $0.79/lb. tomatoes. These tomato selections were then labelled with initials to distinguish. Then a tomato was selected from each and placed upside-down on a small plate. One of the tomato plates was labelled with a note with a star on the bottom, while the other was left unmarked. A piece of paper was folded up with the key for which batch the starred plate corresponds to. 

We are seeking a volunteer to administer the test (the "Administrator"). The Administrator will cut each tomato, keeping them corresponding to their respective plates. They will also mix up the plates so that Chris and Oinkina don't know which plate is labelled. 

We are also seeking volunteers to take the test[^2]. The Administrator will offer a slice from each plate to Chris, Oinkina, and the volunteer tasters. Without conversing, each taster will record their opinions of which plate contained the better tomato. 

Finally, the Administrator will open up the paper with the key and tally the marks for each. 

### Plan for Interpreting Results
We will consider which tomato on average received the higher rating, and also which Oinkina and Chris individually preferred.

### Expected Results
It is expected that Oinkina will be more likely to determine the higher quality of her selected tomato than other subjects. 

### Potential Issues
While the ultimate objective would be to determine the quality of Oinkina's tomato selection relative to an average Tomato Selector, Chris is not representative of an average Tomato Selector, due to his many years of training as a vegetarian and vegan. This experiment can only give insight into the differences between Oinkina's selection and Chris'. A conflating factor is that the batch at the El Chico wasn't very high quality.

### Significance
This research will resolve important open problems in the field, primarily: 

1) Do Oinkina and Chris have a real preference for the tomatoes that they pick, or is it perhaps psychological? 

2) Are Oinkina's or Chris' selection objectively superior (as determined by third-party volunteers)?

[^2]: pending approval from the 7D Ethics Board for Use of Human Subjects

We also drew up a [consent form] with the following terms for our volunteers:

<blockquote>
### Volunteer Terms

**Risks/Discomforts:**
There are no foreseeable risks/discomforts in this study.

**Costs to you:**
There are no costs to you.

**Benefits:**
You are not likely going to benefit in any way from joining this study, beyond receiving two slices of tomato of questionable quality. However, your participation in this study will contribute to our understanding of tomato selection and its affect on quality, such that we can look to improve the average tomato quality at 7D.

**Confidentiality:**
You will not be asked for your name or other identifying information. The data that is collected will be kept private to the extent allowed by law. To make sure that this research is being carried out in the proper way, the 7D Internal Review Board may review study records. However, the aggregate information may be used in a blog post by Oinkina.

**Subject Rights:**

* Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to be in this study if you don't want to be.
* You have the right to change your mind and leave the study at any time without giving any reason, and without penalty. 
* You may spit out a particularly unpleasant tomato slice if need be, without any penalty.

**Questions About the Study or Your Rights as a Research Subject:** 
If you have any questions about the study, you may contact Oinkina or Chris at 7D, San Francisco.

Results
---------

At 22:30, the experiment commenced.

Tomato slices were tasted and results were tallied.

Turns out, everyone except Oinkina believed that Chris' tomato was of higher quality, and Chris won with a total of 34 to 29 (each tomato was given a score between 0 and 10, by 5 participants). Interestingly, Oinkina scored her tomato higher, as predicted.


Conclusion and Discussion
-----------

Volunteers explained that they chose Tomato B, Chris' tomato, over A because it was sweeter. It is possible that they have a less sophisticated taste for tomato. It is also possible that Oinkina's tomato preferences vary from the general population's, but that she knows her own preferences well.

It is also important to note that the sample size was incredibly small, and perhaps it is futile to assume that there could be anything of statistical significance resulting from this experiment. Further experiments will be necessary to resolve the original questions.
